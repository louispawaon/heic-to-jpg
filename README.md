# **heic-to-jpg**
converting heic files using the internet is cumbersome so i made this not-so-intuitive way of converting things

# **Installation**
To run this script, you will need to install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can do this using pip by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt  # for Windows
```

Alternatively, you can manually install the required libraries by running the following command for each library:

```
pip install <library-name>
```

# **Usage**
To use the script, run the following command in your terminal:

```
python3 converter.py
```
Choose the folder with your HEIC file/s, and it will automatically place the converted HEIC files to the same path destination of your HEIC file/s folder.
